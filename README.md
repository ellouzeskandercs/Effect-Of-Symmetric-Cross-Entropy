This project is part of the deep learning course at KTH. The aim of the project is to study the effect of the symmetric Cross Entropy based on the paper ** Symmetric Cross Entropy for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels **.

## Run the code:

- Run main.py to train and evaluate models.

- Functions for loading the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST are found in data.py.
